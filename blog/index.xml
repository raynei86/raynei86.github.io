      <description>Motivation Variadic templates are weird.
They can&amp;rsquo;t be iterated through with a loop and the recursive approach is odd.
Although I personally do dislike how variadic templates are handled in C++, I hope you learn to cognize it at the end of this post.
Parameter packs == Lists Parameter packs are similar to lists in Lisp. The recursive approach is identical to how you unwrap a list in lisp. One warning though, you may be Lost In a Sea of Parentheses.</description>

      <description>Motivation In the TCCPP discord server, this was a question that was asked recently:
Why does scanf only work when I scan for char before int?
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt; int main() { int n; char c; scanf(&amp;#34;%d&amp;#34;, &amp;amp;n); // Code works if I put this line below the other scanf scanf(&amp;#34;%c&amp;#34;, &amp;amp;c); return 0; } It&amp;rsquo;s a simple program to read in a number and char, trivial enough to just use two scanf to read them in, right?</description>

      <description>This is my first attempt at &amp;ldquo;serious&amp;rdquo; blogging.
I mainly just want to practice writing more, and also save some of my thoughts.
You can expect some sprinkles of my life, programming topics I find interesting, or just general nerdy stuff :) .
Hopefully you find something intersting in the coming blogs.</description>
